# **Language Translator**

## **Overview**

This project is a simple yet effective language translation application developed using Python. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and leverages the Googletrans library to translate text between various languages. Users can input text, select the source and target languages, and receive instant translations.

## **Features**

* User-friendly GUI created with Tkinter  
* Supports translation between multiple languages  
* Utilizes Google Translate API via the Googletrans library  
* Real-time translation with minimal latency

## **Usage**

1. Launch the application.  
2. Enter the text you wish to translate in the input field.  
3. Select the source language (the language of the input text).  
4. Select the target language (the language you want to translate the text into).  
5. Click the "Translate" button.  
6. The translated text will appear in the output field.

## **Future Enhancements**

* Add support for speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.  
* Implement error handling for network issues and invalid inputs.  
* Enhance the GUI with additional features and improved aesthetics.
